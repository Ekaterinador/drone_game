Shooting drones from a virtual bow.
At the start of the game, the drone flies up to the user and then follows their hand. The user aims by moving their hands, pulling the virtual bowstring. At the moment the unclenching fingers, a shot is fired and the drone follows a ballistic trajectory, depending on the position of the hands.

Socket connection is required to send data to the Unity environment (used when displaying the drone's trajectory in virtual reality glasses).

Requires Vicon Motion Capture System.
